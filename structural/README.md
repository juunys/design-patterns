# Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients. The Adapter allows certain classes to work together that would otherwise be impossible because of their incompatible interfaces;
- **Bridge**: lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other;
- **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent parts-whole hierarchies. Composite allows clients to uniformly treat individual objects and compositions of objects;
- **Decorator**: lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors;
- **Facade**: provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
- **Proxy**: provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
