# Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients. The Adapter allows certain classes to work together that would otherwise be impossible because of their incompatible interfaces;
- **Bridge**: lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other;
