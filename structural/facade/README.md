# Facade pattern

## Intention

*Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.*

---

The Fa√ßade is the simplest pattern of all. It is intended to make life easier for client code by creating a facade object for a more complex system.

## Applicability

Use the Facade when:
* you want to provide a simpler interface to a complex system;
* you want to create entry points to certain parts of the system, such as external services, application layers, and complex objects within certain parts of the code.

## Execute

`go run .`
