# Behavioral Patterns

- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations;
- **Iterator**: provides a way to sequentially access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation
- **Memento**: without violating encapsulation, it captures and externalizes an object's internal state, so that it can later be restored to that state;
- **State**: allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to have changed its class.
- **Strategy**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them and make them interchangeable. The strategy allows the algorithm to vary independently of the clients that use it.
