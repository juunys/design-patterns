# Creational Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes;
- **Builder**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations;
- **Factory Method**: Define an interface to create an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory Method lets you defer instantiation to subclasses;
- **Prototype**: Specify the types of objects to be created using a prototype instance and create new objects by copying that prototype;
- **Singleton**: Ensure that a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access for it.
